    "Alice was the reported winner of the contest. \n",
    "The goal of the audit is to check whether Alice really won.\n",
    "If she did, the audit will usually stop without looking at every ballot card. \n",
    "If Alice did _not_ really win, the audit has a large chance of leading to a full hand count to determine who did win.)\n",
    "\n",
    "This audit demo involves manually reading votres from randomly selected ballot cards.\n",
    "it does not use information from the electronic voting system.\n",
    "This type of RLA is called \"ballot polling.\"\n",
    "(There are RLA methods that use other information from the voting system, for instance, vote subtotals for precincts\n",
    "or the machines' record of the votes on individual ballot cards.)\n",
    "Ballot polling has similarities to an exit poll, except that instead of asking people how they voted, \n",
    "it looks at ballots to see what votes were recorded.\n",
    "Unlike a survey of voters, the ballots have to answer, and they have to answer truthfully.\n",
    "(The goal is also different: a risk-limiting audit does not try to estimate vote shares,\n",
    "only to determine who won.)\n",
    "\n",
    "RLAs can be based on sampling \"with replacement\" (the same card can be selected\n",
    "more than once) or on sampling without replacement (each card is selected at most once).\n",
    "The formulas for computing the risk using sampling without replacement are more complicated.\n",
    "This demo uses sampling _with_ replacement so that the calculations can be done by hand.\n",
    "If the same card is selected more than once, there is no need to _retrieve_ it more than once: \n",
    "you already know what vote it shows.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this demo, the expected number of cards you need to inspect to confirm the outcome is about {int(expect_size)}, \n",
    "including duplicates. \n",
    "Because the sample is drawn with replacement, the audit workload depends on the candidates _shares_\n",
    "of the vote, not on the total number of votes or cards cast.\n",
    "That is, the number of draws required to confirm the outcome would be expected to be \n",
    "about {int(expect_size)} cards whether there were 100 ballot cards\n",
    "or 1,000,000 ballot cards in the election.\n",
    "The only difference is that when the election is smaller, it's more likely that the sample will contain\n",
    "the same card more than once, so the number of cards that have to be _retrieved_ is expected to be smaller.\n",
    "Of course, {int(expect_size)} is a much larger fraction of 100 than it is of 1,000,000.\n",

    "A mathematician named Jean Ville proved in 1939 that in any sequence of fair or sub-fair bets, the chance you ever multiply your initial bankroll by any number $c$ is at most $1/c$, if you're not allowed to borrow money (that is, if you go broke, you're out).\n",
